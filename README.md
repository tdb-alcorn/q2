# q2

A reinforcement learning framework and command line tool.


## Get it

```
pip install q2
q2 --help
```

## Use it

Make a folder, `cd` to it, then run

```
q2 init
```

to generate a new reinforcement learning project.

## Docs

Documentation is available at https://q2.readthedocs.io/.


## Develop

 
0. You'll need Python >= 3.5 (this is because q2 makes use of type annotations)
1. Clone this repository
2. I recommend setting up a virtual env in which to develop: `python -m venv env`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To test out the command line tools from your working copy of q2, run

```
pip install -e .
```

then run

```
q2 --help
```

to test that it worked.
